<h1>A little bit about me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Cayley. I'm 23 years old and I live in London, ON. I just moved to London last month from Windsor, ON. I was a student at the University of Windsor in Communication, Media & Film. I chose to pursue this program at Fanshawe to round out my skill set, and because I wanted to combine my creativity with computer science.</p>	

<h2>Some photos!</h2>
<p>I don't take pictures of myself very often, so here are some (I think) pretty photos I took while I was in Edmonton last month.</p>

<h3>A pretty sunset</h3>

<h3>A mossy log and a little fungi</h3>

<h3>Reflection on the water</h3>

<p>I love being in nature, so these pictures are really special to me. I made my friend hike down bluffs and we scraped our knees - just cause I wanted to see a beaver dam up close, or grab a couple cool rocks. It was worth it.</p>
